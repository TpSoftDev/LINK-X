Storm Intensity and Frequency 
Global weather patterns appear to be changing and climatologists suggest that the increasing intensity and 
frequency of storms may be related to modern, anthropogenic inﬂuences (IPCC, 2001; Nott, 2003; Nott, 2004; 
Nott et al., 2007). Studies into storm trends have shown that while SSTs have been rising, the intensity of the 
storms occurring in this time period has increased (Hoegh-Guldberg, 1999; IPCC, 2001; Hughes, 2003; Web­
ster et al., 2005; IPCC, 2007; NOAA Satellite and Information Service, 2007). While sheer numbers of tropical 
storms have remained relatively constant, the destructiveness of the cyclones has increased over the past 30 
years and hurricanes in the Category 4 and 5 range have nearly doubled since the 1970s (Emanuel, 2005;"

How did the POBSP contribute to our understanding of seabird populations in the Pacific?,"The POBSP contributed to our understanding of seabird populations in the Pacific by providing a general baseline for five species of seabirds that breed on various islands and atolls within the NWHI. The program included at-sea bird observations, breeding population counts, and banding, which helped gather data on species such as Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses, Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, Red-tailed Tropicbirds, and Sooty Terns. However, the documentation of breeding population size data was not well detailed, leaving some uncertainty about whether the population estimates referred to the total number of individuals or just the number of breeding individuals.","differed across these locations.

an increase in annual population size of 
approximately 5.7% per year (95% CI: 
5.3 - 6.1%) over that 32-year time peri-
od (Figure 6.40; Balazs and Chaloupka, 
2006). 
The increase in green turtle nest-
ing population size at French Frigate
Shoals (Figure 6.41) may be attributed 
in part to increased protections under
the ESA, as harvesting of turtles on land 
or in waters surrounding the Hawaiian 
Islands was prohibited beginning in the 
late-1970s. However, human impacts
on beach nesting habitat at French Frig-
ate Shoals also changed dramatically
over the last half of the 20th century.
From the late 1930s to early 1950s, the 
U.S. Navy and USCG operated Naval
Air and Long Range Navigation stations
on East Island; during that time, turtle
nesting and basking reportedly greatly
decreased (Amerson, 1971). After the

What factors contribute to the differences in infection rates of L. kasmira between Hawai’i and French Polynesia?,"The differences in infection rates of L. kasmira between Hawai’i and French Polynesia are contributed to by fish size and geographic location.

What factors might influence the movement patterns of jobfish compared to giant trevally?,"Factors that might influence the movement patterns of jobfish compared to giant trevally include differences in their spawning strategy and a tendency for greater diel movement.

The mean number of basking turtles also showed variability, with a maximum of 5.4 baskers per day in 1982.

How does the relationship between coral hosts and their symbionts influence their response to thermal stress?,"The relationship between coral hosts and their symbionts influences their response to thermal stress by determining the tolerance of corals to bleaching. Different coral species and their specific symbiont partners can affect how well the corals can withstand extreme temperatures. For instance, host adaptation and the presence of unexpected symbiont partners can enable reef-building corals to tolerate higher temperatures. Additionally, variations in bleaching sensitivity among coral species can be linked to the type of zooxanthellae they harbor.","33

In what ways do different habitats affect the growth rates of coral species like Porites lobata?,"Different habitats affect the growth rates of coral species like Porites lobata by exhibiting varying growth rates depending on the specific conditions of each habitat. For instance, at Kure Atoll, the fore reef has the lowest growth rate compared to other habitats.

How do oceanographic conditions influence fish diversity in different regions?,"Oceanographic conditions, such as water temperature, influence fish diversity by affecting the survival of shallow-water fish species. In the NWHI, winter water temperatures can be as much as 7ºC cooler than in the MHI, which means that many shallow-water fish species adapted to warmer waters cannot survive there. Conversely, some species that are adapted to cooler water can be found in deeper waters at the southern end of the archipelago. This results in lower reef fish diversity in the NWHI compared to the MHI.","ing to oceanographic conditions (e.g., water temperature), habitat (e.g., coral and reef type) and anthropogenic 
inﬂuences (e.g., effects of ﬁshing in the MHI).

How do the carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of different fish groups reflect their dietary habits?,"The carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of different fish groups indicate their dietary habits by showing the sources of their food. Benthic Predators exhibit a range of approximately 3‰ in both C and N isotope signatures, with some, like the blacktail wrasse, having 15N values greater than 10, suggesting they feed 2.5 to 3.0 trophic levels above primary producers. The whitesaddle goatfish and Hawaiian hogfish have the most enriched 13C values among Benthic Predators, indicating a diet that includes more benthic production. In contrast, Pelagic Predators have relatively depleted 13C values, suggesting a significant contribution from phytoplankton to their diet, while their average 15N values of 9.3‰ are similar to those of Benthic Predators, reflecting comparable trophic levels.","a signiﬁcant portion of benthic produc­

In what ways do the feeding strategies of Corallivores and Pelagic Predators differ based on their isotopic signatures?,"The feeding strategies of Corallivores and Pelagic Predators differ in their isotopic signatures in that Corallivores have a more enriched carbon (C) isotope signature, indicating a greater contribution of coral and benthic algae to their food web. In contrast, Pelagic Predators exhibit relatively depleted carbon (C) values, suggesting that phytoplankton contributes substantially to their food webs.
