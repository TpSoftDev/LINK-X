48 Introduction
49 Coral disease is a significant factor impacting coral reefs with localized disease outbreaks 
50 occurring worldwide [1,2].  The single most damaging disease outbreak, stony coral tissue loss 
51 disease, has been devastating coral reefs throughout the Florida Reef Tract since 2014 [3–5] and 
52 has spread to neighboring Caribbean regions [6]. Outbreaks of coral disease have increased 
53 through time [7] and have been linked to anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing [8], plastic 
54 pollution [9], dredging activities [10], terrestrial runoff [11,12], and increased ocean 
55 temperatures [13,14].

What is an assumption common in models that predict the future of coral cover?,Models that predict the future coral cover of reefs typically assume that corals will be unable to compensate for increasing temperatures over relatively short timescales,An assumption common in models that predict the future of coral cover is that corals will be unable to compensate for increasing temperatures over relatively short timescales.,"M
odels predict that reef ecosystems throughout much of
the tropics will decrease in coral cover, diversity and/or
undergo phase shifts in the coming decades [30–33]. An
assumption of these models is that corals will be unable to
compensate for increasing temperatures over relatively
short timescales. The ability to associate with diverse sym-
bionts has been suggested as one mechanism by which
corals might be able to respond rapidly to environmental
change [17,19,25,26,34–37]. However, it has been
argued that symbiont-mediated acclimatization is not feas-

change are expected to be the most signiﬁcant impacts and likely to occur in the NWHI (Selkoe et al., 2008). 
Although the effects of global warming and coral bleaching on coral reef ﬁshes are of concern worldwide 
(Pratchett et al., 2008a), they are relatively more important in the NWHI where resources are now protected 
from other human impacts by establishment of the Monument. 
The prevalence and dynamics of coral and related substrata (e.g., algal secondary cover) represent the most 
obvious habitat issues for shallow-water reef ﬁshes in the NWHI. Although corals are important as a food 
source only for relatively few, specialized ﬁshes in tropical reef ecosystems including Hawaii (Cole et al. 2008),

INTRODUCTION 
As coral reefs worldwide are increasingly challenged by global phenomena such 
as climate change and ocean acidification (Hughes et al., 2003; Pandolfi et al., 2003; 
Kleypas et al., 2006), it becomes increasingly important to establish detailed quantitative 
baselines by which subsequent changes can be discerned. Pauly (1995) introduced the 
phrase “shifting baseline syndrome” in connection with fisheries, but the concept applies 
equally well to other marine ecosystem resources, including coral reefs (Birkeland,

When conducting experiments in the field how do people capture the positions of the coral to make sure they continue to look at the same piece?,"Common methods include tagging, photographing, and recording positions using GPS.","In the field, researchers capture the positions of corals by using spatial reference methods, such as marking the locations with physical markers (like iron stakes) or using GPS coordinates.

What is a drawback to lesion removal on diseased coral?,It can be somewhat difficult to do and time consuming.,"A drawback to lesion removal on diseased coral is that, although it can stop tissue loss at the initial site of infection and promote healing, re-infection can still occur. In the study, new lesions appeared on other areas of treated colonies, indicating that lesion removal does not prevent the overall progression of the disease and may not be a long-term solution. Additionally, the treatment was only performed once, which means that continued tissue loss could result from new infections.","of healing wounds created by the removal of disease
lesions should not have long-term impacts on the
coral colonies. Although potentially confounding evi-
dence has been reported that wounds can increase
susceptibility to some diseases (Aeby & Santavy
2006, Page & Willis 2008), the above-mentioned
treatments remain a potentially important means of
containing some types of disease outbreaks in the
short term. The increasingly numerous records of
successful disease treatments will aid resource man-
agers in addressing the growing threat of coral dis-
ease outbreaks.
While morbidity- and mortality-reducing tech-
niques have been developed for many plant and ani-
mal species (Nandakumar et al. 2001, Warrell et al.
2008), only a few are available for corals. Therefore,
our objective was to test lesion removal as a method
of disease treatment to reduce morbidity or mortality
from tissue loss associated with cMWS lesions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study sites","For example, Williams (2013) found that growth
anomaly removal was a successful treatment for A.
acuminata but not for M. efflorescens located on the
same reef under similar environmental conditions.
Although somewhat time consuming, lesion removal
would be effective in controlling disease in closed
systems such as coral nurseries, at the onset of a dis-
ease outbreak, on reefs with a low incidence of
cMWS, or for treating colonies that are of the most
value to the reef (Raymundo et al. 2008). While
lesion removal has proven beneficial for cMWS-
infected colonies, management actions that address
the overarching drivers of coral disease (e.g. nutri-
ent runoff from human and animal waste, overfish-
ing, and rising surface seawater temperatures) are
required to maintain the long-term viability of coral
reefs (Bruckner 2002). The complexity of a coral’s
response to disease, the efficacy of lesion treatment,
and the response of different pathogens to treatment","likelihood of developing an appropriate method of
control. Due to the declining state of many coral
reefs, a treatment method that reduces morbidity in
affected colonies may be warranted.
Previous research has proposed that disruption of
the coral animal through mechanical injury increases
susceptibility to some diseases (Aeby & Santavy
2006, Page & Willis 2008), suggesting that corals are
either more susceptible because they have an open
wound that can subsequently become infected or
that some systemic change takes place to weaken
the entire organism, thereby making it generally
more susceptible to disease. In our study, although
treated colonies were re-infected with cMWS within
a few weeks post-lesion removal, new infections
never occurred at the removal site, indicating that
tissue disruption was not required for cMWS initia-
tion. In addition, the development of new lesions
was similar between the 2 groups, suggesting that

an acute lesion in the last sampling interval, but no
acute tissue loss lesions were observed on the treat-
ment colonies. Despite the increased rate of tissue
loss from aMWS infections, the late timing of the
switch in disease state did not alter the average rates
of tissue loss calculated.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we applied a lesion-removal tech-
nique to cMWS-infected Montipora capitata colonies
to assess its viability as a treatment measure.
Lesion removal stopped tissue loss at the initial site
of infection, and all wounded colonies healed
within 5 wk of treatment. However, re-infection
was ob served, and new lesions appeared on other
areas of every control colony and all but 1 treat-
ment colony (Fig. 4B). Lesion removal was only

and white skeleton. AWS results in a progressive tissue
loss leading to partial to total colony mortality depend-

be transmissible through direct contact in controlled
studies (Aebyet al., 2011); histological analyses of tissues
