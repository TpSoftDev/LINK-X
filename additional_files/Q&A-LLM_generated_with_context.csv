What are the ecological roles of parrotfishes in tropical reef ecosystems?,"The ecological roles of parrotfishes on tropical reefs include grazing, which has functional implications for the ecosystem. They play a significant role in maintaining the health of coral reefs by controlling algal growth and contributing to the bioerosion and sediment production processes.","Parrotfishes play several important ecological roles in tropical reef ecosystems. They are primarily herbivorous fish that contribute to the grazing of macroalgae, which helps maintain the balance between coral and algae on reefs. This grazing activity prevents macroalgae from overgrowing and outcompeting corals for space and resources.

Additionally, parrotfishes are significant bioeroders, meaning they help in the production of sediment by eroding carbonate substrates. This bioerosion contributes to the overall sediment dynamics of the reef environment. Some species of parrotfishes are considered the most important carbonate substratum bioeroders among herbivorous fishes on shallow-water reefs.

Furthermore, parrotfishes can influence the structure of reef communities by their feeding habits, which can affect the distribution and abundance of other reef organisms. Their role in sediment production and grazing makes them crucial for the health and sustainability of tropical reef ecosystems.","Programme and GRID, Nairobi, 98p

foraging of macroalgae below 100 m. Parrotfishes may also 
be important contributors to sediment production on meso -
photic reefs. Weinstein et al. ( 2015) found a strong correla -
tion between adjusted bioeroding parrotfish biomass and 
percent of coral-derived particles in upper mesophotic reef 
sediment. However, additional studies from other regions are 
necessary to determine whether this is a general trend for 
mesophotic reefs on low-  angle slopes. The available litera -
ture supports the finding that, globally, parrotfish are more 
common in shallow-water reefs and most species found on 
mesophotic reefs are not substantial bioeroders (Table 43.2) 
or are at low abundances.

What are the implications of seasonal and diel movements of fish species for the design of Marine Protected Areas?,The implications of seasonal and diel movements of fish species for the design of Marine Protected Areas include the need to consider these movements to effectively protect the species. Understanding the patterns of movement can inform the placement and management of these areas to ensure that critical habitats are preserved and that fish populations are supported throughout their life cycles.,"The implications of seasonal and diel movements of fish species for the design of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) include the need to consider the timing and patterns of fish movements when establishing boundaries and regulations. Understanding these movements can help in identifying critical habitats that need protection during specific times of the year or day. 

For instance, if certain fish species migrate to specific areas for spawning or feeding at particular times, MPAs should be designed to encompass these areas during those critical periods. Additionally, recognizing the connectivity between different habitats used by fish throughout their life stages can inform the placement of MPAs to ensure that they protect not only the habitats themselves but also the migratory routes that fish use.

Overall, incorporating knowledge of fish movements into MPA design can enhance the effectiveness of these protected areas in conserving fish populations and maintaining biodiversity.","bilis) at remote Hawaiian atolls: implications for the design of Marine Protected Areas.

INTRODUCTION 
The Northwestern Hawaiian Islands 
(NWHI) provide habitat for an estimated 
5.5 million nesting seabirds represent­
ing 22 different species (see Figures 
7.1 and 7.2 and Fefer et al., 1984). For 
many of these species, the Monument 
provides the majority of available nest­
ing habitat. Nesting occurs throughout 
the year, varying by species and within 
species, and by annual food availability 
(Harrison, 1990). The largest breeding 
populations occur at Midway Atoll, Lay­
san Island and Nihoa (USFWS, 2005). 
While the Monument protects seabird 
breeding and nesting habitat, the for­
aging ranges for most of these species 
extend beyond the Monument’s bound­
aries, with foraging distances ranging 
from 3 km to several thousand kilome­","ture, the dominance by large numbers of endemic species, and the occurrence of a number of threatened and 
endangered species makes the NWHI an ecosystem of global signiﬁcance.

aging ranges for most of these species 
extend beyond the Monument’s bound­
aries, with foraging distances ranging 
from 3 km to several thousand kilome­
ters (e.g., Fernández et al., 2001). Some 
seabird species occur year-round in the 
Monument, while others migrate to oth­
er parts of the Paciﬁc when not breed­
ing. Juvenile birds may also remain at 
sea for several years before returning 
to their breeding colonies inside Monu­
ment water. Overall, the NWHI provide 
high-quality breeding habitat, with low 
predation risk and low disturbance con­
ditions (Table 7.1). 
The distribution of seabirds within the 
Monument reﬂects, to some extent, the 
nesting habitat currently available on 
the islands (Tables 7.2 and 7.3). Nesting distribution has also been affected by human disturbance in the late 
19th and 20th centuries, including egg and feather hunting, and destruction of habitat due to military activities"
What methods have been used to monitor population trends of seabirds in the NWHI since the last complete inventory?,More intensive monitoring at three islands has been used to derive population trends of seabirds in the NWHI since the last complete inventory.,"The methods used to monitor population trends of seabirds in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) include large-scale monitoring that began in the early 1960s with the Smithsonian Institution’s Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program (POBSP).

However, the data collection methods have differed across these locations, making geographical comparisons difficult. Additionally, standardized methods for monitoring reproductive success and survival have been suggested to improve the comprehensiveness of the data collected.","In addition, standardized methods for monitoring reproductive success and survival at French Frigate Shoals, 
Laysan and Midway Atoll would allow for more comprehensive geographic comparisons of seabirds nesting 
within the Monument. The collection of at sea seabird survey data should be conducted on a regular basis in 
order to gain a better understanding of the at sea behavior and environmental conditions for foraging. Currently 
a single survey was conducted by the NOAA Paciﬁc Southwest Fisheries Science Center in 2002. This type of 
survey needs to be conducted again and at different times of year in order to gain a better understanding of all 
the seabirds in the NWHI throughout the year.

Large-scale monitoring of seabird populations in the NWHI began in the early 1960s, with the Smithsonian 
Institution’s Paciﬁc Ocean Biological Survey Program (POBSP). This program was followed by Tripartite Co­

Spatial Distribution 
Limiting the population monitoring data to three of the islands/atolls within the NWHI reduces our ability to 
analyze population productivity, survival and community composition across the archipelago. The remoteness, 
year-around breeding, and underground nesting habits of some of the petrel species make breeding seabird 
surveys at all of the islands within the Monument logistically difﬁcult. Nest density calculations at the various 
islands, along with information regarding available habitat (and the extent covered by introduced plants), might 
allow for analysis and predictions of future impacts from changing sea levels and vegetation change over time.

How did the POBSP contribute to our understanding of seabird populations in the Pacific?,"The POBSP contributed to our understanding of seabird populations in the Pacific by providing a general baseline for five species of seabirds that breed on various islands and atolls within the NWHI. The program included at-sea bird observations, breeding population counts, and banding, which helped gather data on species such as Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses, Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, Red-tailed Tropicbirds, and Sooty Terns. However, the documentation of breeding population size data was not well detailed, leaving some uncertainty about whether the population estimates referred to the total number of individuals or just the number of breeding individuals.","The Paciﬁc Ocean Biological Survey Program (POBSP) contributed to our understanding of seabird populations in the Pacific by conducting extensive at-sea bird observations, breeding population counts, and banding on various islands and atolls from 1963 to 1970. The data collected during this program provided a general baseline for five species of seabirds that breed in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), including Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses, Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, Red-tailed Tropicbirds, and Sooty Terns. 

Although the population size data from the POBSP were not well documented in terms of the types and timing of the counts, the program allowed for general comparisons of population sizes between different islands and atolls during the time period of the surveys. This foundational data has been useful for subsequent studies and monitoring programs, even though direct comparisons to current population size estimates are complicated due to differences in data collection methods over time.","differed across these locations.

Available Data 
Large-scale monitoring of seabird populations in the NWHI began in the early 1960s, with the Smithsonian 
Institution’s Paciﬁc Ocean Biological Survey Program (POBSP). This program was followed by Tripartite Co­
operative Agreement Studies in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and by the current long-term monitoring pro­
gram initiated in 1980 by the USFWS at French Frigate Shoals, Midway Atoll and Laysan Island. The current 
USFWS seabird monitoring program provides information on seabird populations over time within French Frig­
ate Shoals, Midway and Laysan, but geographical comparisons are difﬁcult, as data collection methods have 
differed across these locations.

What challenges are associated with interpreting the population size data collected during the POBSP?,"The challenges associated with interpreting the population size data collected during the POBSP include the lack of well-documented information regarding the types and timing of the counts, which makes it unclear whether the population estimates represent the total number of individuals or just the number of breeding individuals.","The challenges associated with interpreting the population size data collected during the POBSP include:

1. Lack of Clarity: It is not entirely clear if the population estimates reported were for the total number of individuals or specifically for the number of breeding pairs. This ambiguity makes it difficult to compare the data from the 1960s to current population size estimates.

2. Documentation Issues: The breeding population size data presented were not well documented in terms of the types and timing of the counts, which complicates the interpretation of the data.

3. Comparison Difficulties: Due to the unclear nature of the data, making accurate comparisons of population sizes between different islands and atolls is challenging.

These factors contribute to difficulties in understanding the true population dynamics of the seabird species studied during the POBSP.","counts, it is not entirely clear if population estimates were total number of individuals or number of breeding

In Hawai’i, 63.5% of Lutjanus kasmira were infected, with even higher rates in specific regions, such as 82.3% in the southeastern half of the archipelago. In contrast, the overall prevalence in French Polynesia was 34.7%.

How do environmental factors influence coral disease prevalence in different regions?,"Environmental factors such as coral cover, degree of heat stress (measured by DHW), and amount of bleaching were expected to affect disease prevalence. However, the study found no significant relationship between disease prevalence and coral cover or DHW. Additionally, there was a negative relationship between these factors and disease prevalence, contrary to the expected positive relationship.","Environmental factors influence coral disease prevalence in different regions through various mechanisms, including the degree of heat stress, coral cover, and water quality. For instance, the study mentioned indicates that coral cover can range significantly across survey sites, which is a measure of host abundance. However, it was found that there was no significant relationship between disease prevalence and coral cover or degree heating weeks (DHW), which measures heat stress.

Additionally, localized environmental stressors, such as sedimentation and anthropogenic impacts like overfishing and pollution, can exacerbate disease levels. In regions like the northeastern Arabian Peninsula, higher disease prevalence was observed, attributed to these environmental stresses. Overall, while some expected relationships between environmental factors and disease prevalence were not found, the presence of stressors and the overall health of the coral ecosystem play critical roles in influencing disease outbreaks.","23

460 The survey sites were spread out along a latitudinal gradient spanning from 19˚ to 24˚N.  Among 
461 the survey sites, coral cover (a measure of host abundance) ranged from 3% to 83%, degree of 
462 heat stress, as measured by DHW, ranged from 2.5 to 5.3 and amount of bleaching ranged from 
463 0% to 54%.  All three of these co-factors would be expected to affect subsequent disease 
464 prevalence and as expected, average disease prevalence varied from 0% to 1.9%.  However, no 
465 significant relationship was found between disease prevalence and coral cover or DHW.  And 
466 even more surprising, there was a negative relationship, not a positive one as expected, between","3

47 frequency and severity of ocean warming. 
48 Introduction
49 Coral disease is a significant factor impacting coral reefs with localized disease outbreaks 
50 occurring worldwide [1,2].  The single most damaging disease outbreak, stony coral tissue loss 
51 disease, has been devastating coral reefs throughout the Florida Reef Tract since 2014 [3–5] and 
52 has spread to neighboring Caribbean regions [6]. Outbreaks of coral disease have increased 
53 through time [7] and have been linked to anthropogenic impacts such as overfishing [8], plastic 
54 pollution [9], dredging activities [10], terrestrial runoff [11,12], and increased ocean 
55 temperatures [13,14]. 
56 Coral reefs face different threats depending on their geographic region.  The Red Sea is a 
57 unique environment for corals being a partially enclosed body of water with limited exchange","26
524 sediments is an ongoing stress for coral reefs in this region as well [107].  Under these 
525 conditions, higher coral disease levels were found and attributed to environmental stress [108].  
526 Compared to our study, reefs along the northeastern Arabian Peninsula show a 6-fold higher 
527 disease prevalence with a high number of localized disease outbreaks [64].  Reefs surrounding 
528 Kish Island, off the coast of Iran, showed a 20-fold increase in disease [109].  Disease is a 
529 serious problem in other world regions [3,12,40] and our study suggests that a reduction in 
530 human impacts and improvement in water quality may be effective management strategies giving 
531 corals increased capacity to withstand the warming oceans predicted with global climate change.

Pearl and Hermes Atoll 
Impacts on the seal population at Pearl and Hermes Atoll started in 1859 when a sealing expedition visited the 
atoll. In the late 1920s pearl oysters were harvested and construction occurred on the islands. The U.S. military 
occupied the atoll in 1961 during construction of an observation tower. The atoll is now unoccupied except for 
NMFS summer ﬁ eld camps. 
The Pearl and Hermes Atoll seal population declined by an estimated 90% after the 1950s (Figure 6.34). From 
the mid-1970s to 2000 beach counts have increased. Speciﬁcally from 1983 to 2000 counts increased an aver­

Executive Summary
•	Hawaiian monk seals have shown dramatic declines since the late 1990s but these declines differ among 
locations and for various reasons. French Frigate Shoals currently supports the largest colony but has 
also shown the steepest decline (75% since 1989) with low juvenile survival. Laysan and Lisianski have 
remained fairly constant over the past decade. Pearl and Hermes is the only location to have shown an 
increase in the past 10 years. Low population numbers at Midway and Kure are likely the result of long 
histories of human disturbance.
•	Green turtle populations continue to increase in the NWHI, representing a major conservation success 
story. French Frigate Shoals accounts for over 90% of the nesting population with Laysan, Lisianski, and 
Pearl and Hermes accounting for the remainder. Despite extensive potential beach nesting habitat at","Finn, M., J.R. Henderson, B.L. Becker, and T.J. Ragen. 1993. The Hawaiian monk seal and green turtle at Pearl and

How did human activities in the 20th century impact the seal populations across different atolls?,"Human activities in the 20th century, such as sealing expeditions, pearl oyster harvesting, and military occupation, significantly impacted seal populations across different atolls. At Pearl and Hermes Atoll, the seal population declined by an estimated 90% after the 1950s due to these activities. Although there was an increase in beach counts from the mid-1970s to 2000, counts have declined since 2000, similar to trends observed at Kure Atoll and Midway Atoll.","Human activities in the 20th century significantly impacted the Hawaiian monk seal populations across different atolls in various ways:

1. **Kure Atoll**: Human disturbance began with sailors who killed seals for food after the shipwreck of the Parker. The U.S. Coast Guard's LORAN station also caused disturbances. Efforts to reduce these disturbances began in the late 1970s, and the LORAN station was decommissioned in 1992. Despite these efforts, recent trends indicate a decline in the seal population.

2. **Midway Atoll**: The monk seal population was severely depleted by the late 1800s due to human activities, including attempts to blast a ship channel, the installation of a cable station, and military activities during World War II. After the war, the human population peaked and then decreased significantly by 1978. Although there was a brief increase in seal counts from 1995 to 2000, counts have declined since then.

3. **Pearl and Hermes Atoll**: The seal population faced impacts starting in 1859 with sealing expeditions, followed by pearl oyster harvesting and military occupation in the 1960s. The population declined by an estimated 90% after the 1950s, but from the mid-1970s to 2000, beach counts increased. However, like the other atolls, counts have declined since 2000.

4. **Lisianski Island**: The island experienced disturbances due to shipwrecks and the activities of stranded sailors, similar to the other atolls, but specific details on the impact on seal populations were not provided.

Overall, human activities such as hunting, military operations, and habitat disturbances have led to significant fluctuations and declines in the Hawaiian monk seal populations across these atolls throughout the 20th century.","each island and atoll. Each subpopulation exhibits different population dynamics that reﬂect their unique histo­
ries and environmental conditions (Figure 6.34). 
Kure Atoll 
The Hawaiian monk seal population at Kure Atoll has been impacted over the years by human disturbance. 
Beginning with sailors stranded after the ship wreck of the Parker who killed seals for food and continuing with 
disturbance caused by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) LORAN station. In the late 1970s NMFS began efforts 
with the USCG to reduce the level of disturbance to the Hawaiian monk seals. USCG decommissioned the 
LORAN station in 1992. Since 1992 state of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources and the Ma­","human disturbance by USCG regulations and the closure of the LORAN station (Gilmartin et al., 1986). In ad­
dition 54 immature female seals were released at Kure and reached reproductive maturity by the early 1990s. 
(NMFS, 2007). Recent trends indicate a decline in the Kure population. 
Midway Atoll 
Midway Atoll has also had a history of human disturbance, starting in 1859, which has impacted the Hawaiian 
monk seal population (Figure 6.34). The monk seal population was depleted by the late 1800s and partially 
recovered in the early 1900s. Human activities in the early 1900s included attempts to blast a ship channel, 
installation of a cable station, construction of an airport and other World War II military activities. After World 
War II the human population peaked at 3,500 and was reduced to 250 by 1978 (NMFS, 2007). The 1957-1958 
monk seal surveys recorded a mean of 57 seals but by 1968 only one seal was observed (Kenyon, 1972).","were put in place to reduce disturbance to monk seals. There was a short ﬁve year increase in beach counts 
from 1995 – 2000 followed by a decline since 2000. 
Pearl and Hermes Atoll 
Impacts on the seal population at Pearl and Hermes Atoll started in 1859 when a sealing expedition visited the 
atoll. In the late 1920s pearl oysters were harvested and construction occurred on the islands. The U.S. military 
occupied the atoll in 1961 during construction of an observation tower. The atoll is now unoccupied except for 
NMFS summer ﬁ eld camps. 
The Pearl and Hermes Atoll seal population declined by an estimated 90% after the 1950s (Figure 6.34). From 
the mid-1970s to 2000 beach counts have increased. Speciﬁcally from 1983 to 2000 counts increased an aver­
age of 6%. As seen at Kure Atoll and Midway Atoll counts have declined since 2000.

"What trends can be observed in the beach counts of monk seals from 1995 to the present, and what might this indicate about their conservation status?","From 1995 to 2000, there was a short five-year increase in beach counts of monk seals, followed by a decline since 2000. This trend indicates that while there was a temporary improvement in the seal population during the late 1990s, the subsequent decline suggests ongoing challenges to their conservation status.",I don't know,"II for the population to have plausibly recovered from the impact of the military disturbance, and some military 
presence was still having a negative effect on the monk seals at that time.  
The ﬁrst range-wide surveys of Hawai­
ian monk seals were conducted in the 
late 1950s (Kenyon and Rice, 1959; 
Rice, 1960). Additional counts were 
conducted at Midway Atoll in 1956­
1958 (Rice, 1960) and at Kure Atoll in 
1963-1965 (Wirtz, 1968). Surveys were 
repeated throughout the 1960s and 
1970s, and while the methods were not 
standardized, complete beach counts 
are roughly comparable between the 
two survey periods. 
Since the early 1980s NMFS has been 
conducting annual surveys using stan­
dardized methods to estimate the popu­
lation of Hawaiian monk seals. The work 
is conducted at ﬁeld camps that are ac­
tive from approximately April through 
August (Figure 6.31). All of the ﬁeld 
camps collect information on the num­","seals still alive (Figure 1.9) and if the declining population trend continues there will be fewer than 1,000 within 
the next three or four years, a decrease of more than 60% since the 1950s. When compared historically, the 
monk seal beach count abundance index reached record lows in 2005.

9","it appears that the species declined by approximately 50% between the late 1950s and the mid 1970s (Ke­
nyon, 1973; Johnson et al., 1982). Beach counts of non-pups (juveniles, sub-adults and adults) declined by 
68% between the years 1958 and 2005. 
Based on the very limited window of data availability, the largest counts of monk seals observed at many 
islands were obtained around 1958. Three exceptions to this were French Frigate Shoals, where the maxi­
mum count was obtained in 1985, Mokumanamana where the maximum was obtained in 1977, and Nihoa 
where the maximum was obtained in 1991. The sum, across all sites in the NWHI, of the maximum counts, 
whenever obtained, totals 1,541, corre­
sponding, after a very uncertain correc­
tion, to an estimated population size of 
around 3,000. There is evidence, at a 
minimum, that the available habitat was 
probably capable of supporting at least 
3,000 monk seals in the NWHI plus an 
unknown number in the MHI.","monk seal surveys recorded a mean of 57 seals but by 1968 only one seal was observed (Kenyon, 1972). 
There were occasional sightings in low numbers during the 1980s (NMFS, 2007). Midway’s small monk seal 
population saw increases in the early 1990s as management efforts were increased to reduce disturbance. By 
1988 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) was actively participating in the management of wildlife at 
Midway Atoll in conjunction with the U.S. Navy. Since 1988, the USFWS has restricted the numbers of staff and 
visitors to Midway Atoll. Hawaiian monk seal beach counts increased during the 1990s but this was primarily 
due to immigration of individuals from Pearl and Hermes Atoll and Kure Atoll. In addition to immigrants, there 
were increases in total births. In 1996 the Navy transferred Midway Atoll to the USFWS and further measures 
were put in place to reduce disturbance to monk seals. There was a short ﬁve year increase in beach counts"
What are the potential consequences of habitat loss for species that rely on emergent land in the NWHI?,"The potential consequences of habitat loss for species that rely on emergent land in the NWHI include a significant reduction in available habitat, which will impact many species that are already rare.

able to identify the potential threats and evaluate the impact of the threat to the overall functioning of the eco­
system at a local scale as well as a regional scale. 
In a recent threat analysis of the NWHI region, 24 potential threats were analyzed based on vulnerability fac­
tors and order of magnitude of the threat (Selkoe et al., 2008; Table 10.1). The analysis was focused on threats 
to the marine environment across the NWHI region. A systematic and quantitative method was used to collect 
and synthesize expert opinion on the ecological effects of these potential anthropogenic threats to the region.","ture, the dominance by large numbers of endemic species, and the occurrence of a number of threatened and

examining the ecozones and assessing how a threat may impact each speciﬁc area. The inner and outer reef 
zones were identiﬁed as the most vulnerable. Emergent land was considered vulnerable because of sea level 
rise and the potential loss of habitat. The shallow water ecozones were more vulnerable to extra-boundary 
threats than local threats. Many of these top threats are dif ﬁcult for local managers to control because they 
arise from activities outside the Monument boundaries, indicating that additional work is needed to preserve 
the NWHI despite its highly protected status. The analysis indicates where interagency cooperation in remov­
ing and mitigating threats should be focused (Selkoe et al., 2008)"
How might rising sea levels affect the overall biodiversity of the NWHI ecosystem?,"Rising sea levels may lead to the loss of habitat, particularly emergent land, which is estimated at a total of 14 km2 in the NWHI. This reduction in available habitat will greatly impact many species, especially those that are already rare and depend on these islands for survival. Marine species such as the Hawaiian monk seal, green turtle, and several sea-bird species will be affected. Additionally, habitat degradation may occur due to the release of contaminants from landfills and other areas as the islands are eroded or flooded, further threatening biodiversity in the ecosystem.","Rising sea levels in the NWHI (Northwestern Hawaiian Islands) are expected to significantly impact overall biodiversity in several ways. The loss of emergent land, which is estimated at a total of 14 km², will reduce available habitat for many species, particularly those that rely on these land features for survival. This habitat loss will likely have devastating effects on already rare species, including the Hawaiian monk seal, green turtle, and various seabird species.

Additionally, the degradation of habitats due to flooding and erosion may release contaminants from landfills and other areas, further harming the ecosystem. Changes in sea surface temperature (SST) can lead to coral bleaching, which affects not only coral species but also the fish and other marine organisms that depend on coral reefs for shelter and food. 

The introduction of alien species and the potential for ship groundings pose further threats to biodiversity, as these can disrupt ecosystem functions and lead to long recovery times. Overall, the combination of habitat loss, degradation, and the introduction of new threats will likely lead to a decline in biodiversity within the NWHI ecosystem.","stand the effects on the ecosystem it must be monitored at the island and atoll scale.

In what ways could the degradation of habitats due to sea level rise impact marine species and their populations?,"The degradation of habitats due to sea level rise could impact marine species and their populations by reducing the available habitat for many species, particularly those that rely on emergent land features.

Furthermore, the release of contaminants from landfills and other areas as the islands are eroded or flooded could further degrade habitats, negatively impacting marine species.","The degradation of habitats due to sea level rise can impact marine species and their populations in several ways:

1. **Loss of Habitat**: As sea levels rise, emergent land decreases, leading to a reduction in available habitat for species that rely on these areas, such as the Hawaiian monk seal, green turtle, and various seabird species. This loss can be particularly devastating for already rare species that depend on these habitats for survival.

2. **Contaminant Release**: Erosion and flooding of islands can lead to the release of contaminants from landfills and other areas, further degrading marine habitats and potentially harming marine species.

3. **Coral Bleaching**: Changes in sea surface temperature (SST) associated with climate change can lead to coral bleaching, which negatively affects coral reef ecosystems. Since corals provide essential shelter and habitat for many marine species, their degradation can disrupt the entire ecosystem.

4. **Impact on Prey Species**: Alterations in the ecosystem due to habitat loss and changes in temperature can affect the availability of prey species for marine predators, including seabirds and fish, leading to declines in their populations.

5. **Invasive Species**: The introduction of alien species, which can be exacerbated by habitat degradation, poses a threat to native marine species and can disrupt ecosystem functions.

Reproductive Success 
Annual nesting success (total number of chicks ﬂedged/total number of eggs laid) from 1996 – 2006 is pre­
sented in Figure 7.50 below for Laysan and Black-footed Albatrosses, Bulwer’s Petrels, Red-footed Boobies, 
Masked Boobies, Red-tailed Tropicbirds, Black Noddies, and Gray-backed Terns. Black-footed Albatross re­
productive success has remained relatively stable – between approximately 70-80% - over the 11-year period, 
while Laysan Albatross success has been lower and more variable – between 30% and just over 70% - during 
the same time period. Reproductive success for Red-tailed Tropicbirds and Gray-backed Terns appears to 
have declined substantially after the 1996 and 1997 breeding seasons, while all other species’ nesting success 
ﬂuctuated annually over that time period. Cause of the extremely low reproductive success for Black Noddies"

Results and Discussion 
French Frigate Shoals 
Amerson (1971) reports that green turtles were ﬁ rst recorded at French Frigate Shoals by personnel on the 
USS Fenimore Cooper in 1859. In 1882, the crew of the Japanese-owned schooner Ada reported collecting","bers of baskers during this time period were reported on East Island in the 1960s, with the highest number 
recorded (86 turtles) in September 1966. Turtle pits were also recorded through the late 1960s on Tern, Trig, 
Whaleskate, Round, East, Gin and Little Gin Islands (Amerson, 1971). 
More recently, NOAA personnel have quanti ﬁ ed the number of green turtles basking on all islands within 
French Frigate Shoals during the nesting season. In 2006, an average of 143 turtles was observed basking at 
any one time.

Island, French Frigate Shoals, indicate

Green turtles have been observed 
basking at all of the islands and atolls 
within the Monument, but nesting at-
tempts have been limited to the islands 
and atolls from French Frigate Shoals to 
Midway Atoll. As previously described, 
more than 90% of green turtle nesting 
occurs at French Frigate Shoals, with 
a range of approximately 100 to 550 
females digging approximately 450 to 
2,500 nests each year (Table 6.6). In 
contrast, between 15 and 91 pits have 
been observed on Laysan and Lisian-
ski Islands in any one year, 1-13 pits 
per island at Pearl and Hermes Atoll 
per year, and only one nest per year at 
Midway Atoll between 2006 and 2008 
(Table 6.5). As the number of nesting 
females on East Island, French Frig-
ate Shoals has increased over the last 
three decades, the numbers of nests

How did human activities in the mid-20th century impact turtle nesting and basking behaviors?,"Human activities, specifically the operation of Naval Air and Long Range Navigation stations by the U.S. Navy and USCG on East Island from the late 1930s to early 1950s, reportedly greatly decreased turtle nesting and basking behaviors during that time.","Human activities in the mid-20th century, particularly the operations of the U.S. Navy and USCG on East Island from the late 1930s to early 1950s, reportedly led to a significant decrease in turtle nesting and basking behaviors.

of turtle pits and basking turtles from 
March through June 1982 (Kam, 1986). In 2007, USFWS personnel surveyed the perimeter of Laysan Island 
regularly throughout the green turtle nesting season and monitored active nests for hatching (Payne et al., 
2007). On Lisianski Island, NMFS personnel counted the number of pits dug and number of basking turtles 
through various portions of the nesting season each year from 1982 to 1987, and 2006 and 2007 (Kam, 1985;

2007 (Kam, 1986; Finn et al., 1993; Kubis, 2008; M. Snover, pers. comm.). At Midway Atoll, the ﬁ rst observa-

What role did legal protections play in the recovery of the green turtle population over the studied time period?,"Legal protections under the ESA contributed to the increase in the green turtle nesting population size at French Frigate Shoals by prohibiting the harvesting of turtles on land or in the waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands, which began in the late-1970s.","Legal protections played a significant role in the recovery of the green turtle population over the studied time period.

These protections helped to mitigate the impacts of human activities, such as the loss of nesting habitat and fishery interactions, which had previously contributed to population declines. As a result, the Hawaiian green sea turtle stock has shown signs of recovery after more than 25 years of protecting their nesting and foraging habitats.","Marine Protected Species

The long-term trends based on a population model for the East Island nester abundance illustrates a dramatic 
increase in abundance over the past 30-years, and substantial ﬂuctuations in the number of annual nesters 
has been observed (Balazs and Chaloupka, 2006). Such ﬂuctuations are characteristic of green turtle nesting 
populations and reﬂect a variable proportion of females in the population that breed each year in response to 
ocean-climate variability. The Hawaiian green sea turtle stock is showing signs of recovering after more than 
25 years of protecting their nesting and foraging habitats in the Hawaiian Archipelago (Chaloupka and Balazs,

What factors contribute to the differences in infection rates of L. kasmira between Hawai’i and French Polynesia?,"The differences in infection rates of L. kasmira between Hawai’i and French Polynesia are contributed to by fish size and geographic location. Specifically, fish size is significantly related to infection rate, and there is also a significant effect of geographic location after controlling for fish size. Additionally, Hawaiian L. kasmira harbored more parasites per infected host compared to populations in French Polynesia.","The differences in infection rates of L. kasmira between Hawai’i and French Polynesia can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Geographic Location**: The study indicates a significant effect of geographic location on infection rates, with Hawai’i showing higher infection rates compared to French Polynesia (ANCOVA, F = 37.8, P < 0.001).

2. **Fish Size**: Fish size was found to be significantly related to infection rates (ANCOVA, F = 9.9, P = 0.002), suggesting that larger fish may have higher infection rates.

3. **Prevalence of Infection**: In Hawai’i, a higher percentage of L. kasmira were infected (63.5% overall, and 82.3% in the southeastern half of the archipelago) compared to French Polynesia (34.7%).

4. **Parasite Load**: Hawaiian L. kasmira harbored more parasites per infected host than those in French Polynesia, indicating a higher intensity of infection in Hawai’i.

These factors combined suggest that both environmental conditions and biological characteristics of the fish populations contribute to the observed differences in infection rates.","sampled in French Polynesia (Hawai’i: N = 288, mean fish

How does fish size relate to the infection rates of L. kasmira in different geographic locations?,"Fish size is significantly related to infection rate, with larger fish being more likely to be infected.

prevalence were not due to sampling bias, we also used an
ANCOVA to test for the effect of fish size (weight in grams was
chosen because we had a complete dataset) on the proportion of
fish infected. We tested for differences between the number of
parasites per infected fish (intensity) using an unpaired t-test. To
control for fish size, we also tested for differences in the number of

What factors might influence the movement patterns of jobfish compared to giant trevally?,"Factors that might influence the movement patterns of jobfish compared to giant trevally include differences in their spawning strategy and a tendency for greater diel movement. Additionally, jobfish perform complete seasonal shifts in their home range, which may also affect their movement patterns.","The movement patterns of jobfish compared to giant trevally may be influenced by several factors, including:

1. **Spawning Strategy**: Jobfish have a different spawning strategy than giant trevally, which may affect their movement patterns. Jobfish perform complete seasonal shifts in their home range, occupying separate summer and winter core areas that do not overlap.

2. **Diel Movement**: Jobfish tend to exhibit greater diel movement compared to giant trevally, which may lead to differences in their detection rates and movement patterns.

3. **Home Range**: The home range behavior of jobfish involves seasonal shifts, while giant trevally are more site-attached and may not exhibit the same level of seasonal movement.

4. **Environmental Factors**: Factors such as water temperature, availability of prey, and habitat structure may also influence the movement patterns of both species.

5. **Behavioral Ecology**: The ecological roles and behaviors of the two species as apex predators may lead to different movement strategies in response to their environment and prey availability.

Overall, these factors contribute to the distinct movement patterns observed in jobfish and giant trevally.","A Marine Biogeographic Assessment of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands

Jobfish Movement
Movement patterns for jobfish were sim-
ilar to those observed for giant trevally 
(Figures 9.15). For example, all fish de-
tected at Rapture Reef were tagged at 
Disappearing Island, located close to 
Rapture Reef (Figure 9.16). However, 
there was no evidence that Rapture 
Reef is a spawning location for jobfish. 
Jobfish tagged along the south coast of 
Pearl and Hermes Atoll were detected 
by receivers on both the southwest and 
southeast tips (Figure 9.17). This sug-
gests behavior associated with long, 
daily and tidal excursions.
Overall, jobfish had lower numbers of 
detections/day than giant trevally. This 
may be a function of a key difference in 
their spawning strategy, as well as a ten-
dency for greater diel movement. Unlike 
giant trevally, jobfish perform complete

dency for greater diel movement. Unlike 
giant trevally, jobfish perform complete 
seasonal shifts in their home range, oc-
cupying separate summer and winter 
core areas. These winter and summer 
locations do not overlap, which is why 
each receiver generally has fewer de-
tections on an annual basis. However, 
jobfish were occasionally detected in 
their winter or summer location during 
the opposing season, suggesting that 
these seasonal core areas are relatively 
close to each other.

How do spawning strategies affect the detection rates of different fish species?,"Spawning strategies may affect the detection rates of different fish species by influencing their movement patterns. In the context provided, jobfish had lower numbers of detections per day compared to giant trevally, which may be attributed to differences in their spawning strategies and a tendency for greater diel movement in giant trevally.",I don't know,"complete seasonal shifts in habitat as can be seen by the absence of detections during either the summer or

one spawning location at the atoll.","habitats. Similarly, hull, net and trap inspections are tied to the distribution of invasive species and may provide

inﬂux of outside larval reception. Settlement and recruitment studies which ignore propagule origins may have 
difﬁculty in relating observed patterns to oceanographic features for this very reason. Since neither measure 
is a strong proxy for the other, the futility of understanding transport dynamics given the single aggregated 
measure is readily apparent. The need for additional genetics studies and other stock identiﬁcation markers for 
sourcing of incoming propagules is urgent (e.g., Bernardi et al., 2002; Schultz et al., 2007). 
Clearly since the connectivity measures appear high for adjacent habitats, over evolutionary time the genetic 
connectivity might be more pronounced than inferred here. This could be particularly important at the southern 
boundary of the PMNM, with a protected spawning source able to effectively seed areas to the south over time","to the spawning location, as they re­

show strong site ﬁdelity to core areas (Figure 9.12). Giant trevally were detected at receivers at other parts of 
the atoll, suggesting that these areas were on the periphery of the ﬁsh’s home range. These were most likely

In addition, marine species that also use emergent land such as seabirds are negatively impacted by invasive

able to identify the potential threats and evaluate the impact of the threat to the overall functioning of the eco­
system at a local scale as well as a regional scale. 
In a recent threat analysis of the NWHI region, 24 potential threats were analyzed based on vulnerability fac­
tors and order of magnitude of the threat (Selkoe et al., 2008; Table 10.1). The analysis was focused on threats 
to the marine environment across the NWHI region. A systematic and quantitative method was used to collect

EXISTING DATA GAPS 
The primary data gap for nonindigenous and invasive species in the NWHI is a complete survey of nonindig­
enous species across habitats. Surveys need to have a greater spatial distribution to have a more complete 
picture of the nonindigenous and invasive species populations. The following are key datasets needed for 
management and future research efforts: 
• 	Species inventory; 
• 	Population size; 
• 	Rate of spread; 
• 	Spatial distribution; and 
• 	Habitat requirements and natural history information for established populations to use in habitat suit-
 ability models.

What role does the USFWS play in the conservation efforts in the NWHI?,The USFWS is conducting native plant restoration and other alien species removal projects to increase available nesting habitat in the NWHI.,"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) plays a significant role in the conservation efforts in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) by being one of the federal agencies assigned protective responsibilities in the area. They are involved in the management and protection of endangered species and their habitats, as well as overseeing the implementation of conservation measures established through various designations, such as the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument. The USFWS collaborates with other federal and state agencies to ensure the conservation and management of the unique ecosystems and cultural resources in the NWHI.","class data. Permission to work in the NWHI was granted by the Pacific Remote Islands 
Wildlife Refuge Complex, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior and 
the State of Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. Funding from NOAA’s 
Coral Reef Conservation Program and the NWHI Coral Reef Ecosystem Reserve 
supported this work, with facilitation by Tom Hourigan and Robert Smith, respectively.","The NWHI has a long history of human use and increasing efforts for conservation management (Figure 1.11). 
Native Hawaiians traversed and seasonally used the NWHI for hundreds of years and continue today to main­
tain their strong cultural ties to the land and sea of the NWHI. Post-Western-contact, the NWHI continued to be 
explored and the harvest of natural resources including guano mining, egg harvesting, ﬁshing and other natu­
ral resource extraction occurred. The U.S. Military maintained active military bases during much of the 1900s. 
In 1909 the ﬁrst natural resource protection was put in place with the designation of the Hawaiian Islands Bird 
Reservation. Since that time, additional reserves and refuges have been established to protect this unique 
ecosystem. The most recent protections were implemented with the designation of the Papahanaumokuakea 
Marine National Monument June 15, 2006.

Short-ﬁnned Pilot Whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) 
The short-ﬁnned pilot whale has a large, bulbous head in which the melon protrudes beyond the mouthline. 
The beak is very short and the mouthline is noticeably upturned toward the eye. The dorsal ﬁn is falcate, set 
forward of the midbody, broad at the base and long relative to its height. Males have distinctly broader dorsal 
ﬁns than females. The species is relatively large with females reaching lengths of 5.5 m and weights of 1,000 
kg and males reaching lengths of 6.1 m and weights of 3,000 kg. The color pattern is generally black or dark 
brown with a light gray throat patch, saddle behind the dorsal ﬁn and streak behind the eye. 
The short-ﬁ nned pilot whale is a tropical to warm-temperate species found between 50°N and 40°S. They typi­
cally occur in deep water.

Short-ﬁnned pilot whales are seen 
throughout the year in the MHI (Shallen­
berger ,1981; Mobley et al., 2000; Baird 
et al., 2003). Shallenberger (1981) not­
ed that group sizes were often greater 
than 100 individuals and rarely smaller 
than 30 individuals. Aerial surveys con­
ducted within 46 km of the coastline 
within the MHI (1993-1998) resulted in 
73 observed groups of pilot whales with 
an average group size of 8.4 individu­
als (Mobley et al., 2000). A summary of 
sighting data from 2000 to 2005 resulted 
in 80 observed groups of pilot whales 
with an average of 20 individuals per 
group (Baird et al., 2005a). Data from 
May and June of 2003 demonstrated 
that the average depth of sighting loca­
tions for 17 groups of pilot whales within 
the MHI was 1,142 m (Baird et al., 2003).

ranging in size from 0.9 m for females to 1.8 m for males. The shape of the dorsal ﬁn is variable, from falcate in 
females and juveniles to tall and erect in males. The color pattern of the killer whale is its most distinctive fea­
ture. The dorsal side of the body is black, as are the pectoral ﬂ ippers. The ventral side of the body is white and 
lobes extend from the belly along each side behind the dorsal ﬁn. Distinct white patches are located slightly 
above and behind the eyes. A gray to white shaded saddle is located on the back behind the dorsal ﬁn. 
Killer whales are considered the most widespread cetacean. They can be found in any marine region but 
are more abundant in cool temperate regions. In the Paciﬁc Northwest, two different groups of killer whales 
have been identi ﬁed. Both the “transients” and “residents” are present year-round, however the “transients”","that the average depth of sighting loca­

EEZ, Barlow et al. (2004) observed 25 
groups of pilot whales, ranging in size from 2 to 28 individuals (Figure 6.14). Four sightings were within the 
Monument boundaries (Barlow et al., 2004). During the 2007 (March-April) NWHI survey, four groups of pilot

What role do environmental factors play in the incidence of diseases affecting coral populations?,"Environmental factors are related to the incidence of diseases in corals, as indicated by the research on black band disease, which examines the relationships between disease incidence and these factors.","Environmental factors play a significant role in the incidence of diseases affecting coral populations. Climatic and anthropogenic stressors can compromise coral host immunity, making them more susceptible to opportunistic infections. Factors such as coral cover, degree of heat stress, and bleaching events can influence disease prevalence. For instance, variations in coral cover and heat stress levels have been observed to affect disease prevalence, although specific relationships can be complex and not always significant. Overall, the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors contributes to the general decline of coral health and increases the likelihood of disease outbreaks.","626 Marine Diseases: Climate Links and Anthropogenic Factors.

Limiting the population monitoring data to three of the islands/atolls within the NWHI reduces our ability to 
analyze population productivity, survival and community composition across the archipelago. The remoteness, 
year-around breeding, and underground nesting habits of some of the petrel species make breeding seabird

important predictors of searching/foraging activity (Kappes et al., in review). During the chick-brooding period, 
adults are constrained by the need to provision their chick frequently so foraging excursions last only one to 
three days on average and range from the colony is typically less than 400 km (Kappes et al., unpublished 
data). When chicks are large enough to defend themselves and are thermally independent, both parents are 
able to forage simultaneously. During this period (i.e., chick-rearing), adults conduct both long and short dura­
tion foraging trips with some trips extending northward to the Aleutian Islands (Fernandez et al., 2001; Hyren­

In what ways might climate change affect the nesting habitats of various seabird species?,"Climate change may affect the nesting habitats of various seabird species by causing habitat destruction, which can lead to a loss of critical breeding areas. This loss of habitat can impact the overall population of species such as the Black-footed and Laysan Albatrosses, as their breeding is concentrated in specific locations like the Monument, Midway Atoll, and Laysan Island. Additionally, other seabird species may also be impacted by the loss of nesting habitat due to climate change.","Climate change may affect the nesting habitats of various seabird species in several ways:

1. **Habitat Loss**: Rising sea levels can lead to the flooding of nesting areas, particularly on low-lying islands and islets that seabirds rely on for breeding. This loss of habitat can significantly impact species that depend on these areas for nesting.

2. **Food Availability**: Changes in sea surface temperatures (SST) can affect the distribution of prey species for seabirds. As prey species move to deeper, cooler waters, seabirds may face decreased food availability or may need to travel further to find food, which can impact their breeding success.

3. **Increased Erosion**: Intense storms and rising sea levels can lead to increased erosion of nesting sites, further reducing the available habitat for seabirds.

4. **Competition and Nest Density**: As nesting habitats are lost, remaining areas may become overcrowded, leading to intra-specific competition among seabirds. This can result in nest destruction and lower reproductive success.

5. **Changes in Ecosystem Dynamics**: The overall health of the ecosystem, including coral reefs and other marine habitats, can be affected by climate change, which in turn impacts the food web that seabirds rely on.

Overall, these factors contribute to the vulnerability of seabird populations, particularly in critical breeding areas.","habitat is destroyed. 
Impacts to seabirds will vary depending upon the species. Over 90% of Black-footed and Laysan Albatrosses 
breed in the Monument and the loss of habitat in this area could affect the overall world population. The largest 
breeding populations of these albatross species occur at Midway Atoll and Laysan Island which were not ana­
lyzed in the sea level rise study, but habitat loss is expected to be similar to Lisianski Island because they are 
both large islands. The predicted decrease in area would not be large, but the species remain vulnerable as 
the islands represent such a critically important breeding area. Other seabird species may also be potentially 
impacted by the loss of nesting habitat as the result of climate change.

Changes in SST poses a threat to coral reef ecosystems in the form of coral bleaching. Corals are symbiotic 
organisms which secrete a hard, mineral calcium carbonate structure. The symbiosis is between microscopic, 
photosynthetic organisms called zooxanthellae that inhabit the soft tissue of the coral polyp. Zooxanthellae 
provide the pigmentation of the coral and produce energy which is donated to the host and contributes sig­

Sea turtles are dependent on terrestrial areas for nesting. Islets in French Frigate Shoals support the majority 
of the Hawaiian green turtle breeding population. The loss of habitat and the possibility for nesting areas to 
be ﬂooded during nesting times could have a large impact on the species. In other regions, green turtles have 
demonstrated intra-speciﬁc nest destruction once habitat is lost and nest density becomes high (Bustard and 
Tognetti, 1969). This behavior may occur among nesting Hawaiian green sea turtles in the Monument if nesting 
habitat is destroyed. 
Impacts to seabirds will vary depending upon the species. Over 90% of Black-footed and Laysan Albatrosses","19th and 20th centuries, including egg and feather hunting, and destruction of habitat due to military activities

likely still recovering after the devegetation of the island by guano miners and hunter-introduced feral rabbits in 
the early 1900s (Ely and Clapp, 1973). Further habitat losses have occurred from the introduction of non-native 
plants like golden crown-beard (Verbisena encelioides) and rodent pests like rats and mice. Numbers of nest­
ing adults of some species are also still increasing on Tern and East Islands at French Frigate Shoals after the 
decommissioning of Naval and Coast Guard stations following World War II (Amerson, 1971).

What are the different types of coral diseases identified in the surveys along the Saudi coast of the Red Sea?,"The different types of coral diseases identified in the surveys along the Saudi coast of the Red Sea are: white syndrome (WS), growth anomaly (GA), endolithic hypermycosis (EH), and bleached (Bl).","The surveys along the Saudi coast of the Red Sea identified the following types of coral diseases: black band disease, white syndromes, endolithic hypermycosis, skeletal eroding band, growth anomalies, and distinct focal bleached patches.","17
319 Discussion
320 Coral reefs are in decline globally and disease has played a significant factor in that decline 
321 [1,35,36].  Comparatively little research has been done on coral disease in the Red Sea and our 
322 study presents important information on types of diseases present on coral reefs along the Saudi 
323 Arabian Red Sea coast, prevalence of diseases, susceptible coral taxa within this region and a 
324 description of the histology of different coral lesions.  Baseline data is particularly relevant 
325 considering the planned mega-building projects such as NEOM (https://www.neom.com) and the 
326 Red Sea project (https://visiontoreality.theredsea.sa), which are expected to exert heavy impacts 
327 on surrounding coral reef ecosystems. Twenty-two reefs were surveyed in the Red Sea along the 
328 Saudi Arabian coast, and robust hard coral (45%) and soft coral (14%) cover, and very low levels","78 conducted coral disease surveys along the Saudi Arabian coast of the Red Sea in October 2015

81 differences in diseases along a latitudinal gradient of environmental conditions and a gradient of

locations without bias when using the same substrate type,

How do the depths at which surveys are conducted vary across different locations?,"The depths at which surveys are conducted vary as follows: 

- In SW Puerto Rico, USA, surveys are conducted at depths of 30–70 meters (García-Sais, 2010) and 50–70 meters (Bejarano et al., 2014).
- In the U.S. Virgin Islands, USA, surveys are conducted at depths of 9–45 meters (Appeldoorn et al., 2016).
- In the Pacific Main Hawaiian Islands, USA, surveys are conducted at depths of 0–100 meters (Smith et al., 2012; Weinstein et al., 2014).
- In the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), USA, surveys are conducted at depths of 3–67 meters (Asher et al., 2017).

What trends can be observed in the nesting and basking behaviors of green turtles on Lisianski Island over the years?,"The observations indicate fluctuations in the number of turtle pits and basking green turtles on Lisianski Island from 1982 to 2007. The number of pits observed varied significantly, with a peak of 91 pits in 1984 and a low of 15 pits in 1986. The mean number of basking turtles also showed variability, with a maximum of 5.4 baskers per day in 1982. Overall, there is no consistent upward or downward trend in either the number of pits or the number of basking turtles over the years, suggesting that nesting and basking behaviors may be influenced by various factors.","The data indicates several trends in the nesting and basking behaviors of green turtles on Lisianski Island from 1982 to 2007:

1. **Variation in Nesting Pits**: The number of turtle pits observed varied significantly from year to year. For example, in 1984, there were 91 pits, while in 1986, only 15 pits were observed. This suggests fluctuations in nesting activity over the years.

2. **Basking Turtles**: The mean number of basking turtles also showed variability. In 1982, the mean was 5.4 baskers per day, while the data does not provide specific daily averages for other years, indicating that basking behavior may not have been consistently monitored.

3. **Increased Monitoring**: The counts were conducted during various portions of the nesting season, indicating a systematic approach to monitoring turtle activity, which may contribute to understanding trends over time.

4. **Long-term Data Collection**: The data spans multiple years and includes observations from different organizations, suggesting a commitment to long-term monitoring of green turtle populations on Lisianski Island.

Overall, while specific trends in the increase or decrease of nesting and basking behaviors cannot be definitively established without more consistent data across all years, the observed fluctuations indicate that both nesting and basking behaviors can vary significantly from year to year.","Marine Protected Species

What factors contribute to the tolerance of corals to bleaching events?,"The factors that contribute to the tolerance of corals to bleaching events include the role of the host, host adaptation, unexpected symbiont partners, and the variation in bleaching sensitivity across different coral species and their associated zooxanthellae.","Factors that contribute to the tolerance of corals to bleaching events include:

1. **Host Adaptation**: Certain coral species may have adaptations that allow them to better withstand thermal stress and bleaching.

2. **Symbiont Diversity**: The presence of different types of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) can enhance the resilience of corals to temperature changes.

3. **Environmental Conditions**: Corals located in areas with stable environmental conditions may be less susceptible to bleaching.

4. **Genetic Factors**: Genetic variations within coral populations can influence their ability to tolerate stress.

5. **Previous Exposure**: Corals that have experienced previous thermal stress may develop a level of tolerance to future bleaching events.

6. **Nutrient Availability**: The availability of nutrients in the environment can impact coral health and their ability to recover from bleaching.

7. **Habitat Characteristics**: Specific habitats, such as shallow back reef and patch reef areas, may influence the severity of bleaching events.

These factors can interact in complex ways to determine the overall resilience of coral reefs to bleaching.","33

How does the relationship between coral hosts and their symbionts influence their response to thermal stress?,"The relationship between coral hosts and their symbionts influences their response to thermal stress by determining the tolerance of corals to bleaching. Different coral species and their specific symbiont partners can affect how well the corals can withstand extreme temperatures. For instance, host adaptation and the presence of unexpected symbiont partners can enable reef-building corals to tolerate higher temperatures. Additionally, variations in bleaching sensitivity among coral species can be linked to the type of zooxanthellae they harbor.","The relationship between coral hosts and their symbionts, particularly zooxanthellae, plays a crucial role in determining how corals respond to thermal stress. Different species of corals have varying tolerances to bleaching, which is influenced by the specific types of symbionts they host. For instance, certain symbiont types may provide better thermal tolerance, allowing the coral to withstand higher temperatures without bleaching. 

Research has shown that the interactions between coral hosts and their algal endosymbionts can define their bleaching response to heat and light stress. This means that the specific combinations of coral species and their symbionts can lead to different outcomes when exposed to thermal stress. Some corals may adapt to extreme temperatures through changes in their symbiont communities, which can enhance their resilience to bleaching events. 

Overall, the host-symbiont relationship is a key factor in the ability of corals to cope with climate change and thermal stress, highlighting the importance of both biological and environmental factors in coral health and survival.","33

How do thermal tolerances in corals influence their susceptibility to disease?,"In some coral species, thermal tolerance comes at the expense of increased disease susceptibility.","Thermal tolerance in corals can influence their susceptibility to disease in a few ways. In some coral species, higher thermal tolerance may come at the expense of increased disease susceptibility. This suggests that while corals may be able to withstand higher temperatures, this ability could make them more vulnerable to diseases. Additionally, factors such as the specific Symbiodiniaceae partners that corals host and their resident microbial communities also play a role in determining both thermal tolerance and disease susceptibility. Overall, the relationship between thermal tolerance and disease susceptibility in corals is complex and may involve trade-offs that are worth exploring further.","487 disease susceptibility [92,93] and this has also been suggested as a possible explanation for high

What factors contribute to the observed discrepancies between DHW values and bleaching events in coral reefs?,"The observed discrepancies between DHW values and bleaching events in coral reefs can be attributed to several factors, including the extraordinarily high thermal tolerances of reef corals in the northern Red Sea, host factors, Symbiodiniaceae partners, and resident microbial communities. Additionally, it is noted that in some coral species, thermal tolerance may come at the expense of increased disease susceptibility.","The observed discrepancies between Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) values and bleaching events in coral reefs can be attributed to several factors:

1. **Thermal Tolerance**: Some coral species, particularly in regions like the northern Red Sea, exhibit extraordinarily high thermal tolerances relative to the ambient temperatures they usually experience. This means that even when DHW values exceed thresholds typically associated with bleaching, corals may not exhibit bleaching due to their ability to withstand higher temperatures.

2. **Host Factors**: The thermal tolerance of corals can be linked to specific host factors, which may influence their resilience to heat stress and bleaching.

3. **Symbiodiniaceae Partners**: The type of symbiotic algae (zooxanthellae) that corals host can affect their thermal tolerance. Different symbionts may have varying abilities to withstand heat stress, impacting the likelihood of bleaching.

4. **Resident Microbial Communities**: The composition of microbial communities associated with corals may also play a role in their health and susceptibility to bleaching and disease.

5. **Disease Susceptibility**: In some coral species, increased thermal tolerance may come at the expense of heightened disease susceptibility, which can complicate the relationship between DHW and bleaching events.

6. **Environmental Stressors**: Other anthropogenic activities, such as increased nutrient loads, sedimentation, and physical damage, can exacerbate bleaching events, regardless of DHW values.

How does latitude influence growth rates in coral habitats?,Latitude influences growth rates in coral habitats by causing a measured latitudinal decrease in growth rates as latitude increases.,"Latitude influences growth rates in coral habitats by affecting temperature and light availability. Generally, coral growth rates tend to decline as latitude increases, particularly in exposed habitats such as the fore reef of atolls or the reef slope of islands lacking lagoons. In these areas, corals experience temperatures that are more akin to offshore sea surface temperature (SST) conditions, which can lead to a measurable decrease in growth rates with increasing latitude.

However, in protected habitats, such as back reef and lagoon environments, corals can grow at similar rates regardless of latitude. This suggests that factors like light and competition for space may play a more significant role in these sheltered environments than the ambient temperatures influenced by latitude. Overall, while there is a general trend of decreasing growth rates with increasing latitude, the specific habitat type can significantly influence this relationship.","bayments sheltered from wave action at the islands lacking lagoons) grow at similar rates regardless of lati­
tude. This is may be explained by the microclimatic conditions experienced by corals growing in the shallower 
lagoon and back reef habitats, which are not closely related to offshore SST (Jokiel and Brown, 2004). Growth 
rates in these habitats may be inﬂuenced more by light and competition for space with other corals than by the 
relatively stable, and sometimes higher ambient temperatures afforded by these protected environments from 
solar heating in shallower lagoons. Conversely, corals growing in exposed habitats throughout the NWHI (i.e., 
fore reef of atolls or the reef slope of islands lacking a lagoon) experience temperatures more akin to offshore 
SST conditions, and therefore are more likely to respond to regional SST gradients, such as decreasing SST 
with increasing latitude, resulting in the measured latitudinal decrease in growth rates in these habitats.","ernmost atolls, presumably caused by reduced mixing due to weaker winds (situated closer to the center of 
the North Paciﬁc high pressure ridge) and decreased circulation due to large shallow water lagoons (Brainard 
et al., 2004; Hoeke et al., 2005). Roughly two-thirds of the variability in growth rate across the archipelago can 
be explained by changes in temperature and light availability (Grigg, 1982). Growth rates for a representative 
species of coral (P. lobata) dominant throughout the chain vary from 3 mm/yr to 13 mm/yr (Grigg, 1982). 
Siciliano (2005), however, reports that, while coral growth rates generally decline as a function of increasing

size distribution for all corals over the four year period at the three sites. 
The collapse of the coral community at southwest site LIS-1P may have been caused by a coral bleaching 
event followed by the overgrowth of algae, the latter perhaps stimulated by plentiful nutrients leaching from 
the island and derived by extensive guano production generated by the large resident seabird populations at 
Lisianski. Ambient water temperature was higher at the site during the 2006 survey and may have a longer 
residence time in shallow depths where solar heating would be higher. Also, the waters to the southwest were 
noticeably greener due to higher phytoplankton productivity. In contrast, water clarity was better, water motion"
In what ways do different habitats affect the growth rates of coral species like Porites lobata?,"Different habitats affect the growth rates of coral species like Porites lobata by exhibiting varying growth rates depending on the specific conditions of each habitat. For instance, at Kure Atoll, the fore reef has the lowest growth rate compared to other habitats. Additionally, the growth rates may be influenced by factors such as depth and exposure, as indicated by Grigg's selective sampling of Porites lobata exclusively in 10 m depth from exposed southwest areas.","Different habitats affect the growth rates of coral species like Porites lobata in several ways:

1. **Habitat Type**: Coral growth rates vary significantly between different habitats. For example, at Kure Atoll, Porites lobata shows the lowest growth rate in the fore reef habitat (0.45 cm/yr) compared to higher rates in back reef (0.74 cm/yr) and lagoon habitats (1.01 cm/yr).

2. **Microclimatic Conditions**: Corals in shallower lagoon and back reef habitats experience microclimatic conditions that are not closely related to offshore sea surface temperatures (SST). This can lead to more stable and sometimes higher ambient temperatures, which may enhance growth.

3. **Light Availability**: Growth rates in protected habitats may be influenced more by light availability and competition for space with other corals rather than by temperature alone.

4. **Exposure to Conditions**: Corals in exposed habitats, such as the fore reef or reef slope, are more likely to experience temperatures that align with offshore SST conditions. This exposure can lead to a decrease in growth rates as latitude increases, as these corals are more directly affected by regional SST gradients.

Overall, the specific environmental conditions and biological interactions present in each habitat play a crucial role in determining the growth rates of coral species like Porites lobata.","with increasing latitude, resulting in the measured latitudinal decrease in growth rates in these habitats.

Therefore exclusive sampling from this 
area is likely to underestimate average 
growth rates per atoll. Even so, Porites’ 
growth rates from the fore reef habitat in 
Siciliano’s study (4.5 mm/yr) are higher 
than those reported by Grigg for Po-
rites lobata (3 mm/yr), even if the data 
for Porites exclude the faster growing, 
branching forms such as P. compressa 
(largely absent from Kure’s fore reef). Encrusting and more massive growth forms of P. lobata and P. ever-","bayments sheltered from wave action at the islands lacking lagoons) grow at similar rates regardless of lati­
tude. This is may be explained by the microclimatic conditions experienced by corals growing in the shallower 
lagoon and back reef habitats, which are not closely related to offshore SST (Jokiel and Brown, 2004). Growth 
rates in these habitats may be inﬂuenced more by light and competition for space with other corals than by the 
relatively stable, and sometimes higher ambient temperatures afforded by these protected environments from 
solar heating in shallower lagoons. Conversely, corals growing in exposed habitats throughout the NWHI (i.e., 
fore reef of atolls or the reef slope of islands lacking a lagoon) experience temperatures more akin to offshore 
SST conditions, and therefore are more likely to respond to regional SST gradients, such as decreasing SST 
with increasing latitude, resulting in the measured latitudinal decrease in growth rates in these habitats."
How do oceanographic conditions influence fish diversity in different regions?,"Oceanographic conditions, such as water temperature, influence fish diversity by affecting the survival of shallow-water fish species. In the NWHI, winter water temperatures can be as much as 7ºC cooler than in the MHI, which means that many shallow-water fish species adapted to warmer waters cannot survive there. Conversely, some species that are adapted to cooler water can be found in deeper waters at the southern end of the archipelago. This results in lower reef fish diversity in the NWHI compared to the MHI.","Oceanographic conditions influence fish diversity in different regions through factors such as temperature, productivity, and habitat availability. Variations in these conditions can create distinct environments that favor different species. For example, in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), latitudinal gradients show that more subtropical and temperate species are found in the northern regions, while tropical species are more common in the southern areas. This pattern is influenced by temperature differences and the availability of suitable habitats.

Additionally, oceanographic phenomena like the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can alter water temperature and productivity, affecting the habitat range and movements of pelagic species. Areas with oceanographic divergence and convergence tend to concentrate forage species, which in turn influences the abundance and diversity of fish species in those regions. Overall, the interplay of these oceanographic factors shapes the fish assemblages and their distribution across different habitats.","These groups exhibit similarities in all the factors that were examined. The environmental factors examined in 
this report are all directly impacted by the changes in the basin wide circulation system. These linkages happen 
over monthly, seasonal, annual and longer term climactic time intervals. Examination of chlorophyll-a, SST, 
SST fronts, and SSHA over climatological and monthly periods make it clear that these factors are linked. 
In addition, these factors correlate with patterns and changes in climactic scale events such as the PDO and 
ENSO. These large-scale oceanographic forcing mechanisms change the characteristics of water temperature 
and productivity across the Paciﬁc, and have a signiﬁcant effect on the habitat range and movements of pelag­
ic species in the NWHI. Tuna are often concentrated near islands and seamounts that create oceanographic 
divergence and convergence zones, which in turn tend to concentrate forage species (PMNM, 2008). Sword­","Oceanographic and Physical Setting
A Marine Biogeographic Assessment of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands 
Recent analyses of SeaWiFS remotely-sensed ocean color data shows an expansion of low productivity ocean 
water worldwide (Polovina et al., 2008). This expansion of low chlorophyll water has reached the Hawaiian 
Archipelago and has implications for the productivity of the entire ecosystem. These oligotrophic areas are 
expected to continue to expand with future global warming forcing (Polovina et al., 2008). 
While there is well documented small-scale (i.e., local) variation in population structures (Ashmole and Ash-
mole, 1967; Boehlert, 1993; Johannes, 1981), the large-scale patterns in oceanography described in this

In what ways does temperature variation affect the distribution of shallow-water fish species?,"Temperature variation affects the distribution of shallow-water fish species by influencing their survival. Species adapted to warmer water cannot survive in cooler conditions, such as those found in the NWHI, where winter water temperatures can be as much as 7ºC cooler than in the MHI. Conversely, some shallow-water species that are adapted to cooler water can be found in deeper waters at the southern end of the archipelago. This phenomenon is illustrated by species like the yellowfin soldierfish, the endemic Hawaiian grouper, and the masked angelfish, which occur in shallow water at Midway.","Temperature variation affects the distribution of shallow-water fish species by influencing their survival and habitat preferences. Species adapted to warmer waters may not survive in cooler environments, such as those found in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI), where winter water temperatures can be significantly lower than in the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI). As a result, these warmer-water species may be absent from the NWHI.

Conversely, some species that are adapted to cooler waters may be found in deeper areas of the NWHI. This phenomenon, known as tropical submergence, leads to a shift in the distribution of fish species based on their temperature preferences. Additionally, as sea surface temperatures (SSTs) change, species that currently inhabit shallow waters may move to deeper depths or different latitudes to find suitable habitat conditions, which can impact the entire marine ecosystem, including species that depend on them for food.","ing to oceanographic conditions (e.g., water temperature), habitat (e.g., coral and reef type) and anthropogenic 
inﬂuences (e.g., effects of ﬁshing in the MHI). 
There are a variety of environmental and

moored observing stations, satellite-tracked drifting buoys, and subsurface instrumented moorings (Table 10.4 
and Figure 10.7) Changes in SSTs will result in changes to available habitat for temperature dependent spe­
cies and coral bleaching. 
As SSTs change species currently using habitat near the surface may move to lower depths or different lati­
tudes to ﬁnd the appropriate habitat conditions. This will end up impacting other species dependent on these 
species. For example, seabirds feed on ﬁsh and other marine species near the ocean surface. As SST in­
creases, seabird prey species move to deeper, cooler water, decreasing food availability for foraging birds, or 
requiring birds to ﬂy further north in the Paciﬁc to obtain food resources.","These groups exhibit similarities in all the factors that were examined. The environmental factors examined in

How do the carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of different fish groups reflect their dietary habits?,"The carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of different fish groups indicate their dietary habits by showing the sources of their food. Benthic Predators exhibit a range of approximately 3‰ in both C and N isotope signatures, with some, like the blacktail wrasse, having 15N values greater than 10, suggesting they feed 2.5 to 3.0 trophic levels above primary producers. The whitesaddle goatfish and Hawaiian hogfish have the most enriched 13C values among Benthic Predators, indicating a diet that includes more benthic production. In contrast, Pelagic Predators have relatively depleted 13C values, suggesting a significant contribution from phytoplankton to their diet, while their average 15N values of 9.3‰ are similar to those of Benthic Predators, reflecting comparable trophic levels.","The carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope signatures of different fish groups provide insights into their dietary habits and trophic levels. 

1. **Benthic Predators**: These fish exhibit a range of approximately 3‰ in both C and N isotope signatures. Benthic Predators with 15N values greater than 10 (like the blacktail wrasse) may be feeding 2.5 to 3.0 trophic levels above primary producers. The most enriched 13C values among Benthic Predators were found in species like the whitesaddle goatfish and the Hawaiian hogfish, indicating a reliance on benthic sources.

2. **Corallivores**: This group has a more enriched C isotope signature, suggesting a greater contribution of coral and benthic algae to their diet compared to other groups.

3. **Pelagic Predators**: These fish have relatively depleted 13C values, indicating a significant contribution from phytoplankton to their food webs. Their average 15N values of 9.3‰ are similar to those of Benthic Predators, suggesting they occupy comparable trophic levels.

4. **Herbivores**: Fish categorized as herbivores have lower 15N values than other consumer organisms, which aligns with their expected dietary habits. However, the offset between the 15N values of algae and some herbivorous fish suggests that some of these fish may actually be omnivores or that the nitrogen values of the algae sampled were more depleted than expected.

Overall, the stable isotope analysis allows researchers to estimate the contributions of different food sources to the diets of various fish groups and to infer their positions within the food web.","a signiﬁcant portion of benthic produc­

from 1.1 to 3.4 ‰ (Figure 9.32).

as expected. However, the offset between the 15N values of algae and several members of the Herbivore group 
was higher than the expected 2 to 4/mil, suggesting that either some of the ﬁsh designated as herbivores are in 
fact omnivores, or that the algal N values obtained during the May 2005 cruise were more depleted than algal

2. **Nitrogen Isotope Signature (15N)**: While the specific 15N values for Corallivores are not detailed in the provided context, it is noted that Zooplanktivores (which may have similar feeding strategies) have 15N values around 8.25‰, indicating they feed at two trophic levels above primary producers. Pelagic Predators, on the other hand, have an average 15N value of 9.3‰, which is similar to that of Benthic Predators, suggesting they may also be feeding at comparable trophic levels but relying more on pelagic sources.

Specifically, it is suggested that the decrease in PAR contributes to lower microborer diversity, as there is typically a greater diversity of microborers reported in shallow reefs compared to their deeper mesophotic counterparts. Additionally, while some microborers may be more common at mesophotic depths, the overall trend indicates that reduced PAR negatively impacts the diversity and abundance of microborers in these deeper environments.","835
depths. Despite the presence of microborers on mesophotic 
reefs, current data suggest that the reduction in PAR with 
depth (Baker et al. 2016) helps regulate microborer taxonomy 
and limits microborer diversity, abundances (Fig. 43.2), and 
carbonate removal by microbioerosion on mesophotic reefs 
(Budd and Perkins 1980; Perry and Macdonald 2002; V ogel 
et al. 2000; Heindel et al. 2009; Wisshak et al. 2011).
43.2.2  Grazing
External bioerosion trends on mesophotic reefs are mostly 
inferred from indirect estimates such as abundances of herbi-
vores. It is critical to note that not all herbivores actually 
remove carbonate from reef substrate (Bellwood and Choat 
1990). Thus, assumptions regarding bioerosion based on her-
bivore abundances, including those herein, may result in 
overestimates. The following depth-related discussion of 
grazers focuses on the organisms for which the most meso -
photic data are currently available: herbivorous sea urchins 
and fishes.","840
applied by some studies only quantify organisms in plain 
view and would thus exclude macroboring organisms that 
can grow on the underside of coral plates, which are com -
mon in mesophotic reefs (e.g., Liddell and Ohlhorst 1988). 
Additionally, the cryptic nature of most macroborers implies 
that PAR is not a major influence controlling their distribu -
tions (Perry and Hepburn 2008). Regardless, observations 
suggest mesophotic coral substrates suffer from high levels 
of internal erosion (Goreau and Hartman 1963; MacGeachy 
1977; Wilkinson 1983; Weinstein et  al. 2014) and imply 
macroborers may have a greater relative impact on the struc-
ture of mesophotic reefs than on shallower reefs (Fig. 43.2).
43.3  Comparing Bioerosion on Mesophotic 
and Shallow Reefs
There are several important trends that distinguish bioero -
sion patterns on shallow versus mesophotic reefs. First, aver-

mesophotic reef development and restructuring.
43.3.1  Why Is Bioerosion Different 
on Mesophotic Reefs?
The contrasts in bioerosion guild dominance between meso-
photic and shallow-water reefs (see Sect. 43.2) stem from the 
variation of multiple factors. Reduced PAR on mesophotic 
reefs (Baker et al. 2016) is likely one of the most significant 
of these factors, triggering heterogeneous distributions in 
herbivorous fishes with depth based on preferred food avail-
ability and nutrition (Bonaldo et al. 2014). It may also have a 
similar impact on sea urchin distribution. External bioerod -
ers often prefer grazing on substrates inhabited by endolithic 
algae (Bruggemann et al. 1996; Wisshak et al. 2010); par-
rotfishes specifically feed selectively on autotrophic micro -
organisms (Clements et al. 2016). Thus, declining PAR not 
only causes reduced microbioerosion rates and abundances","depth; reported rates on mesophotic reefs (0.002–0.123  kg 
m−2 year−1) were up to two orders of magnitude lower than at 
shallower depths (0.208–0.237  kg m −2 year −1; Table  43.1; 
Hoskin et al. 1986; V ogel et al. 2000). Additionally, a greater 
microborer diversity (number of distinct ichnotaxa) is typi -
cally reported in shallow reefs compared to their deeper 
mesophotic counterparts (Günther 1990; Perry and Macdonald 
2002; Gektidis et al. 2007; Wisshak et al. 2011). However, 
depth zonation studies suggest that some microborers are 
more common at mesophotic depths such as rhodophytes (red 
algae) and light- independent fungi and organotrophs (Perry 
1999; V ogel et al. 2000; Perry and Macdonald 2002; Wisshak 
et al. 2011; Färber et al. 2015).
Phototrophic microboring species such as the chlorophyte

nobacterium Leptolyngbya terebrans (Bornet and Flahault

What are the implications of relying on herbivore abundance estimates for understanding bioerosion on mesophotic reefs?,"Relying on herbivore abundance estimates for understanding bioerosion on mesophotic reefs may result in overestimates of bioerosion. This is because not all herbivores actually remove carbonate from the reef substrate, which means that assumptions made based on herbivore abundances could be misleading.","The implications of relying on herbivore abundance estimates for understanding bioerosion on mesophotic reefs include the potential for misinterpretation of bioerosion rates and processes. Since herbivore abundance is linked to the availability and nutritional quality of algal food sources, a decline in herbivorous organisms with depth may lead to reduced bioerosion rates. Additionally, the nutritional content of algal food sources on mesophotic reefs may be lower, which could further impact grazer abundance and, consequently, bioerosion. 

Furthermore, the dominance of different bioerosion guilds, such as sponges on lower mesophotic reefs, suggests that the role of herbivores in bioerosion may differ significantly from that on shallower reefs. This variation complicates the understanding of bioerosion dynamics and may lead to challenges in comparing shallow and mesophotic reef systems. Overall, relying solely on herbivore abundance estimates without considering other factors, such as substrate characteristics and the role of different bioeroders, may provide an incomplete picture of bioerosion processes on mesophotic reefs.","841
decline in herbivorous organisms (including some bioeroders) 
with depth (van den Hoek et al. 1978; Liddell and Ohlhorst 
1988; Morrison 1988). Additionally, Kahng et  al. ( 2010) 
noted that low algal biomass has been linked to heavy graz -
ing and suggested depleted herbivore abundance in meso -
photic coral ecosystems may be related to low structural/
habitat complexity. Beyond abundance, nutritional content 
of EAM is also greatest on shallower exposed reefs (Bonaldo 
et al. 2014). Algal food sources on mesophotic reefs may 
have a lower nutritional value, digestibility, and palatability 
(as suggested by Brokovich et  al. 2010; Bejarano et  al. 
2014), leading to reduced grazer abundance. Further obser -
vations and experiments with regard to the effect of algal 
distribution patterns and nutritional context on bioerosion 
rates are needed on mesophotic reefs. Spatial distribution of 
parrotfishes and other epilithic bioeroders may also be","at depth (Baker and Weber 1975; Hubbard and Scaturo 1985; 
Huston 1985; Weinstein et al. 2016). This allows mesophotic 
reef borers to remove relatively more CaCO3 substrate com-
pared to borers infesting faster-accreting substrates in shal -
lower reefs. The role of internal bioerosion may become 
more important on “deeper” reefs as a result of relative dif -
ferences between coral growth and bioerosion rates (Perry 
and Harborne 2016), but it is still unknown if the relatively 
high amount of internal bioerosion on mesophotic reefs 
compares with the higher grazing rates commonly observed 
on shallower reefs.
43.3.2  Implications of Mesophotic Reef 
Bioerosion
Bioerosion is fundamental to our understanding of past 
mesophotic reefs (see references in Sherman et al. 2019) 
and the evolution of coral reef biodiversity (Weinstein et al. 
2015). Weinstein et al. ( 2015) suggested that sedimentary 
facies, along with other clues from ancient deposits, could","especially true as rapid global environmental changes 
increasingly affect mesophotic reefs (Baker et  al. 2016), 
likely disrupting current patterns of mesophotic bioerosion 
as predicted in shallower reefs (Perry and Harborne 2016).
43.4  Conclusions
Overall, there are three main trends in terms of mesophotic 
reef bioerosion. First, bioerosion by phototroph microborers 
and grazers generally  declines with depth down to meso -
photic reefs. Second, due to reduced grazer densities, 
sponges appear to be the main substrate modifying group on 
lower (and possibly on some upper) mesophotic reefs, 
although on different time scales and with different outcomes 
than on shallower reefs. Third, mesophotic reef bioerosion 
rates may be slower than on shallower reefs. Challenges in 
comparing shallow and mesophotic reef systems arise from 
different substrate characteristics (i.e., age, density, growth 
rate, and amount exposed) and differences in methods","in bioerosion with depth and explore the implications for 
mesophotic reef development and restructuring.

photic and shallow-water reefs (see Sect. 43.2) stem from the

only causes reduced microbioerosion rates and abundances"
How do bioerosion rates vary with depth in marine environments?,Bioerosion rates decrease with depth from shallow (<30 m) to mesophotic depths (30–150 m) at least initially (≤3 years).,"Bioerosion rates generally decrease with depth in marine environments, particularly from shallow reefs (0-30 m) to mesophotic depths (30-150 m). This trend is observed in both temperate and tropical locations, where bioerosion rates are hypothesized to be higher in shallower waters. Additionally, the diversity of bioeroders also tends to decrease with depth, which may be related to the availability of light and the biological basis of the organisms present.","832

erosion of tropical carbonate substrates, with some excep -

several suggestions regarding how future research efforts can

knowledge of bioerosion on mesophotic reefs.
43.2  General Trends of Bioerosion Groups 
with Depth
When generalizing bioerosion trends from shallow to 
mesophotic depths (Fig.  43.2), bioerosion rates are hypoth -
esized to decrease with depth (Hubbard 2009; Perry and 
Harborne 2016), as indicated globally by most quantitative 
studies of bioerosion in temperate to tropical locations with 
measurements including sites at 20 m or deeper (Table  43.1 
and Fig.  43.3). This trend follows two major observations: 
first, that autotrophic microborers are largely restricted to 
euphotic environments (Wisshak 2012) and that light is a 
major regulator of autotrophic microborer depth distribu -","833

~3.2 g m−2 at 5 m to ~2.0 g m −2 at 50 m (Dullo et al. 1995). 
These results imply that sea urchin bioerosion rates gener -
ally decrease with depth and that these organisms are usually 
not major mesophotic reef substrate modifiers.

Herbivorous fish (including bioeroders) biomass and/or 
abundances generally decrease with depth in shallow reefs 
(e.g., Lewis and Wainwright 1985; Bruggemann et al. 1996; 
Friedlander et al. 2010). Of studies that characterized shal -
low to mesophotic herbivorous fish communities, most indi-
cated that their abundance, density, and/or biomass also 
decreased with depth (Thresher and Colin 1986; Brokovich

Fukunaga et  al. 2016; Asher et  al. 2017, but see Lindfield"
What factors might contribute to the decrease in bioeroder diversity with increasing depth?,The decrease in bioeroder diversity with increasing depth may have a biological basis and/or result from the fact that available taxonomic inventories decrease with depth.,"The decrease in bioeroder diversity with increasing depth may be attributed to several factors, including:

1. **Reduced Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR)**: As depth increases, the availability of light decreases, which can affect the growth of autotrophic microorganisms that many bioeroders rely on for food.

2. **Heterogeneous Food Availability**: The distribution of herbivorous fishes and other bioeroders may become less diverse at greater depths due to variations in preferred food sources, leading to a decline in their populations.

3. **Competition and Predation**: Changes in biotic interactions, such as competition for resources and predation pressures, may differ with depth, potentially reducing the diversity of bioeroders.

4. **Substrate Availability and Type**: The type and availability of substrates (both living and dead) may vary with depth, influencing the habitats suitable for different bioeroding species.

5. **Taxonomic Inventories**: The available taxonomic inventories may decrease with depth, leading to less documented diversity in deeper environments.

These factors combined can lead to a decline in both the abundance and diversity of bioeroders as one moves from shallow to deeper reef environments.","(Leske, 1778) observed in the Red Sea decreased with depth 
from ~20 individuals m−2 at 5 m to 1 individual m−2 at 50 m, 
as did the daily bioerosion rates of these individuals from 
~3.2 g m−2 at 5 m to ~2.0 g m −2 at 50 m (Dullo et al. 1995).

2017b). Controlling biotic factors include competition, preda-
tion, and succession (Hutchings 2011;  Perry and Harborne

ecology and biology, their effects on local habitats, and their

Although marine bioeroders are found at all depths where 
reefs occur (see Fig. 43.1 for examples of bioeroders present 
at depths 30–60 m), the majority of bioerosion research has 
been conducted on shallow (<30  m) reefs. Relatively few

In what ways do the dominant groups of bioeroders differ between shallow and mesophotic reefs?,"The dominant groups of bioeroders differ between shallow and mesophotic reefs in terms of their relative dominance. In shallow reefs (0-30 m), external grazers are more dominant, while in upper (30-60 m) and lower mesophotic reefs (60-150 m), the relative dominance of phototrophic microborers and macroborers increases. Additionally, overall bioerosion rates and bioeroder diversity decrease with depth from shallow to mesophotic reefs.","The dominant groups of bioeroders differ between shallow and mesophotic reefs primarily in their rates and types of bioerosion. On shallow reefs, grazers and microborers tend to remove more CaCO3 substrate compared to macroborers. In contrast, on mesophotic reefs, bioerosion rates and abundances of microborers and grazers are often lower initially. Additionally, sponges are likely the most important bioeroders on lower and possibly upper mesophotic reefs, whereas the dominance of other bioeroding groups may vary in shallower waters. This difference in bioerosion guild dominance is influenced by factors such as light availability, substrate characteristics, and the distribution of herbivorous fishes.","There are several important trends that distinguish bioero -
sion patterns on shallow versus mesophotic reefs. First, aver-

material removed by bioerosion are often lower on meso -

CaCO3 substrate than macroborers on shallow and some

data are available regarding pH variability between meso -
photic and shallower reefs (Baker et al. 2016). Therefore, it 
is currently difficult to generalize how these factors and 
their interactions on local and gloabal scales may result in 
bioerosion differences across shallow to mesophotic depth 
gradients.
Substrate characteristics including availability; type;

coral growth rates; and reef carbonate production rates may

studies have addressed bioerosion on mesophotic reefs, 
which we consider here as low-light communities dominated

sponges, and/or other invertebrates in subtropical to tropical 
waters typically at depths of ~30 to 150 m (modified from 
Hinderstein et  al. 2010). Of these studies, most have been 
conducted on upper mesophotic reefs (30–60 m), with few

why bioerosion may differ between mesophotic and shallow-

What role do sponges play in the bioerosion process on mesophotic reefs?,"Sponges are hypothesized to be the main long-term (>5–10 year) agents of bioerosion on lower mesophotic reefs, and this is likely the case on most upper mesophotic reefs as well.","Sponges are hypothesized to be the primary long-term bioeroders on lower mesophotic reefs (60–150 m) and possibly on some upper mesophotic reefs (30–60 m). They are likely the most important bioeroders in these environments, especially given the decline of microboring and grazing bioerosion with depth. While initial grazing bioerosion rates may exceed macroboring rates on some upper mesophotic reefs, sponges are expected to play a significant role in bioerosion over longer timeframes (more than 5–10 years). Their destructive effects on the substrate contribute to the overall bioerosion process in mesophotic reef ecosystems.","ferent on mesophotic reefs compared to their shallow-water 
counterparts. In particular, carbonate grazing and photo -
trophic microboring rates decline with depth from shal -
low to mesophotic reefs. In the absence of significant 
erosive action by grazers, sponges are hypothesized as the 
primary long-term bioeroders on lower mesophotic reefs 
(60–150 m) and possibly on some upper mesophotic reefs 
(30–60 m). Given these factors, we postulate that meso -
photic reef substrates experience slower bioerosion rates 
and lose less carbonate than shallower reefs over the same 
timeframe. This likely stems from differences in photo -
synthetically active radiation and other factors such as 
temperature, sedimentation, bioeroder food abundance 
and quality, substrate characteristics, and exposure time 
for bioerosion. There is a critical need to document meso-
photic bioeroders via taxonomic inventories, as well as 
quantify their bioerosion rates across mesophotic depths","tributors to internal macrobioerosion on most deeper 
(15–50  m) reef fronts (Goreau and Hartman 1963; 
MacGeachy and Stearn 1976; Perry 1998; Grigg 2006; 
Weinstein et  al. 2014;  Perry and Harborne 2016). Furthermore, 
given the general decline of microboring and grazing bioero-
sion with depth (see Sects. 43.2.1 and 43.2.2, respectively), 
we hypothesize that sponges are the main long-term (>5–
10  year) agents of bioerosion on lower mesophotic reefs. 
This is likely the case on most upper mesophotic reefs as well 
(Fig. 43.1e–h). However, since initial (≤3 year) grazing bio-
erosion rates exceeded macroboring rates of shallow coral 
experimental substrates on some upper mesophotic reefs 
(Hassan 1998; Weinstein 2014; Weinstein et al. 2014), there 
is a need for additional research with experimental substrates 
composed of mesophotic coral to test this hypothesis.
Based on the few quantitative studies available, other 
more specific consensus trends cannot be determined for","There are several important trends that distinguish bioero -
sion patterns on shallow versus mesophotic reefs. First, aver-
age bioerosion rates (Table 43.1) and the amount of substrate 
material removed by bioerosion are often lower on meso -
photic reefs than on shallow reefs initially (≤3 year) (Hassan 
1998; Weinstein 2014; Weinstein et al. 2014). This is because 
initially, over the same timeframe, microborer and grazer 
bioerosion rates (see Sects. 43.2.1 and 43.2.2 respectively) 
and abundances (Fig.  43.2) are often lower on mesophotic 
reefs than on shallower reefs. An implication of this is that 
grazers, in association with microborers, remove more 
CaCO3 substrate than macroborers on shallow and some 
upper mesophotic reefs (see Sect. 43.2). Second, sponges are 
likely the most important bioeroders on lower and possibly 
upper mesophotic reefs (see Sect. 43.2.3), given the well-  
documented destructive effects of bioeroding sponges on","cause their abundances to be correlated are represented by double-headed arrows. General trends in macroborer abundances and bioerosion rates 
with depth are currently inconclusive (Table 43.3); this uncertainty is represented for shallow and upper mesophotic reefs by a question mark. Still, 
sponges are hypothesized as the main long-term (>5–10 years) framework bioeroders on lower mesophotic reefs (as indicated by large black circle) 
and to be relatively less dominant than other bioeroder guides in shallower reefs (as indicated by medium black circle). Coral images in the diagram 
represent the general trend that branching and massive coral morphologies are more common on shallower reefs and platy coral morphologies are 
more common on mesophotic reefs
D. K. Weinstein et al."
How does the depth of a reef affect the rates of microboring and grazing bioerosion?,"The general decline of microboring and grazing bioerosion with depth is noted, indicating that these rates decrease as the depth of the reef increases.","The depth of a reef affects the rates of microboring and grazing bioerosion in that both microborer abundance and grazing rates generally decrease with increasing water depth. Studies have shown that microbioerosion rates on mesophotic reefs (30-150 m) are significantly lower than those at shallower depths (0-30 m). For example, reported microbioerosion rates on mesophotic reefs range from 0.002 to 0.123 kg m−2 year−1, which are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the rates at shallower depths, which range from 0.208 to 0.237 kg m−2 year−1. Additionally, grazing rates at deeper sites (20 m) have been found to be significantly lower than at shallower sites, indicating that the overall bioerosion activity decreases with depth.","Hassan 1998; Tribollet and Golubic 2005; Weinstein et al. 
2014). To provide context for total bioerosion patterns on 
mesophotic reefs (Fig.  43.2), we first examine each of the 
major bioeroding guilds separately and discuss how these 
guilds may inhibit or facilitate the action of another group, 
creating an interactive network or loop (Tribollet and 
Golubic 2011; Schönberg et al. 2017b).
43.2.1  Microboring
Studies investigating microbioerosion in tropical to temperate 
waters have found microborer abundance (Wisshak et  al. 
2011) and depth of penetration into carbonate substrate (Budd 
and Perkins 1980; V ogel et  al. 2000; Wisshak et  al. 2011) 
decreases with water depth. Trends from the Bahamas also 
indicate that microbioerosion rates generally decrease with 
depth; reported rates on mesophotic reefs (0.002–0.123  kg 
m−2 year−1) were up to two orders of magnitude lower than at 
shallower depths (0.208–0.237  kg m −2 year −1; Table  43.1;","rarely homogeneous across space and time. Results from 
coral reef studies using experimental substrates indicated 
that bioerosion rates, primarily associated with grazing, were 
lower at deeper sites (20  m; Kiene and Hutchings 1993), 
including most of the upper mesophotic reef sites analyzed 
(Table 43.1; Hassan 1998; Weinstein 2014; Weinstein et al. 
2014). Substrate weight change correlated with bioeroder-  
adjusted parrotfish biomass in the USVI, implying that  
parrotfishes were the most dominant substrate bioeroders 
down to 30–39 m (Weinstein et al. 2014; Smith et al. 2015). 
Based on their Great Barrier Reef study and other studies, 
Kiene and Hutchings ( 1993) proposed that “high grazing 
destruction” occurs from 1 to 20 m depth. These authors also 
found that grazing rates at 20  m (their deepest study site) 
were significantly lower than boring rates after 5  years 
(Kiene and Hutchings 1994). However, past experimental

43.4  Conclusions
Overall, there are three main trends in terms of mesophotic 
reef bioerosion. First, bioerosion by phototroph microborers 
and grazers generally  declines with depth down to meso -
photic reefs. Second, due to reduced grazer densities, 
sponges appear to be the main substrate modifying group on 
lower (and possibly on some upper) mesophotic reefs, 
although on different time scales and with different outcomes 
than on shallower reefs. Third, mesophotic reef bioerosion 
rates may be slower than on shallower reefs. Challenges in 
comparing shallow and mesophotic reef systems arise from 
different substrate characteristics (i.e., age, density, growth 
rate, and amount exposed) and differences in methods"
What gaps in research are identified regarding bioerosion rates on mesophotic coral substrates?,"There is a need for additional research with experimental substrates composed of mesophotic coral to test the hypothesis regarding bioerosion rates, as initial grazing bioerosion rates exceeded macroboring rates on some upper mesophotic reefs.","The identified gaps in research regarding bioerosion rates on mesophotic coral substrates include:

1. A significant need for further research on mesophotic reef bioerosion, especially on lower mesophotic reefs (60–150 m).
2. Relatively few studies have been conducted on bioerosion in mesophotic reefs compared to shallow reefs, with most research focused on upper mesophotic reefs (30–60 m).
3. Additional data on mesophotic coral growth, calcification rates, coral density variation, substrate age, exposed substrate amounts, and sediment composition analyses are needed to better understand the context of mesophotic reef bioerosion in relation to overall reef accretion.
4. There is a need for mesophotic reef carbonate budget studies and analysis of cores collected at these depths to gain more insights into bioerosion processes.
5. Research should aim to determine how bioerosion on mesophotic reefs may change over time and how to manage these ecosystems appropriately.","heights >15 and 8 cm, respectively). We also recommend 
using grazer exclusion cages in these studies to tease out 
the importance of different bioerosion groups.
 4. Additional data on mesophotic coral growth and calcifi -
cation rates, coral density variation, substrate age and 
amounts of exposed substrate, and sediment composition 
analyses will help place mesophotic reef bioerosion in the 
context of overall reef accretion and will allow for more 
holistic comparisons to shallower reefs. Mesophotic reef 
carbonate budget studies and analysis of cores collected 
at these depths are also of critical importance.
